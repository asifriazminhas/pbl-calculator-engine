This folder has samples which may be useful for getting up and running with the engine and also shows how to use the engine in a server and a browser environment

Requirments:
NodeJS and NPM: Available here https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once Nodejs and NPM are installed they should be available in your PATH which can be checked using the commands,
```
node -v
npm -v
```

Once you are sure NodeJS and NPM have been successfully installed cd into the directory containing the engine source code and run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This command installs all the dependencies which the engine needs

Once this done you are ready to start going through samples. Each sample has their own README which explains each sample
