This sample file exports a function which loads all the data that the engine needs to evaluate life expectancy and other values that may be added in the future.

You most probably will never need to worry about how this function works and can safely treat it like a black box. To see how this function is used please see the sample code in the life-expectancy-server and life-expectancy-browser folder.
